The following tags are allowed in the config file.

If a tag isn't in the config file, the default value will be used.
If units (like kg) are added to default values, then the number will always be in that unit.

An f next to the number means it's a floating point and supports decimal numbers.
No f means it has to be integer, as in 1, 2, 3, but not 0.5

ItemSensorUpdateIntervalSeconds: 0.15f seconds
How frequently the item germ/temperature sensors should update (in seconds)
The sensors trigger when items are added or removed. This setting controls
how often the sensor should refresh if nothing changed.
High numbers will lower CPU usage, but also make sensors slower to respond to passive changes.

ItemSensorItemCountFastThreshold: 3
Item germ sensor will update if the number of items in the cell is below or equal this number.
If higher, it will rely on ItemSensorUpdateIntervalSeconds.
If no items, then display will set to 0 and the sensor will sleep until an item arrives.

BatterySensorUpdateIntervalSeconds: 0.15f
Time between updates for the battery sensor.

GasPressureSensorMax: 50f kg
Max value for slider.

LiquidPressureSensorMax: 2000f kg
Max value for slider.
