  The item sensor can be slowed down to reduce CPU load.                            \
  The sensor is event based meaning it updates whenever items are added or removed. \
  Changing higher/lower than or threshold value also triggers an update.            \
  There is however a periodic update, which catches when items change temperature   \
  without being moved. This might not need updates multiple times each second.      \
